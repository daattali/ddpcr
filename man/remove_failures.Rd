\title{Analysis step: Remove failed wells}
\usage{
remove_failures(plate)
}
\arguments{
\item{plate}{A ddPCR plate.}
}
\value{
A ddPCR plate with the droplets in failed wells marked as failed. The plate's
metadata will have a new variable \code{success} which will be \code{FALSE}
for any failed well and \code{TRUE} for all others.
}
\description{
Check if any wells have failed the ddPCR experiment by checking a series
of quality control metrics.  If any well is deemed as a failure, all the droplets
in that well will be assigned to the \emph{FAILED} cluster.\cr\cr

more information about the algorithm used to find failed wells.
}
\details{
This function is recommended to be run as part of an analysis pipeline (ie.
within the \code{\link[ddpcr]{analyze}} function) rather than being called
directly.
}
\note{
This is an S3 generic, which means that different ddPCR plate types can
implement this function differently.
\href{https://github.com/daattali/ddpcr#advanced-topic-3-creating-new-plate-types}{See the README} for
more information on how to implement custom ddPCR plate types.
