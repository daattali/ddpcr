Background
</h1>
Droplet Digital PCR (ddPCR) is a technology provided by Bio-Rad for
performing digital PCR. The basic workflow of ddPCR involves three main
steps: partitioning sample DNA into 20,000 droplets, PCR amplification
of the nucleic acid in each droplet, and finally passing the droplets
through a reader that detects fluorescence in two different wavelengths
(generally set to detect FAM and HEX dyes). As a result, the data
obtained from a ddPCR experiment can be visualized as a 2D scatterplot
(one dimension is FAM intensity and the other dimension is HEX
intensity) with 20,000 points (each droplet represents a point). The
following figure is an example of a scatterplot from ddPCR data.

[![Sample ddPCR
data](inst/vignettes-supp/ddpcr-example.png)](inst/vignettes-supp/ddpcr-example.png)

This package is designed to analyze two-channel ddPCR experiments
(experiments utilizing both fluorescence channels). Single-channel
experiments (where only one fluorescence channel is used) cannot use
this tool.

A two-channel assay typically uses one FAM dye and one HEX dye, and
consequently the droplets will be grouped into one of four clusters:
double-positive (droplets that contain both target sequences and emit
both HEX and FAM fluorescence), FAM-positive, HEX-positive, and
double-negative (empty droplets without any amplifiable template that do
not emit fluorescence in either channel). When plotting the droplets,
each quadrant of the plot corresponds to a cluster; for example, the
droplets in the lower-left quadrant are the double-negative droplets.

After running a ddPCR experiment, a key step in the analysis is gating
the droplets to determine how many droplets belong to each cluster.
Bio-Rad provides an analysis software called QuantaSoft which can be
used to perform gating. QuantaSoft can either do the gating
automatically or allow the user to set the gates manually. Most ddPCR
users currently gate their data manually because QuantaSoft’s automatic
gating often does a poor job and **there are no other tools available
for gating ddPCR data**.

<h1 id="overview">
Overview
</h1>
The `ddpcr` package allows you to import your ddPCR data, perform some
basic analysis, explore the data, and create customizable figures of the
data.

<h2 id="main-features">
Main features
</h2>
The main features include:

-   **Identify failed wells** - identify wells with a failed ddPCR
    reaction. These wells will be excluded from all downstream analysis.
    No template control (NTC) wells will be deemed as failures by this
    tool.
-   **Identify outlier droplets** - sometimes a few droplets can have an
    extremely high fluorescent intensity value that is probably
    erroneous, perhaps as a result of an error with the fluorescence
    reader. These droplets are identified and removed from the
    downstream analysis.
-   **Identify empty droplets** - droplets with very low fluorescent
    amplitudes are considered empty and are removed from the downstream
    analysis. Removing these droplets is beneficial for two reasons: 1.
    the size of the data is greatly reduced, which means the
    computations will be faster on the remaining droplets, and 2. the
    real signal of interest is in the non-empty droplets, and empty
    droplets can be regarded as noise.
-   **Calculating template concentration** - by knowing how many empty
    droplets are in each well, the starting concentration of the target
    DNA in the sample can be calculated (as number of copies of target
    template per microlitre of sample). Calculate the starting
    concentration of the target DNA molecule in the sample, defined as
    the number of copies per microlitre of input.
-   **Gating droplets** - if your experiment matches some criteria (more
    on that soon), then automatic gating can take place; otherwise, you
    can gate the data with custom thresholds just like on QuantaSoft.
-   **Explore results** - the results from each well (\# of drops, \# of
    outliers, \# of empty drops, concentration, etc.) can be explored as
    a histogram or boxplot to see the distribution of all wells in the
    plate.
-   **Plot** - you can plot the data in the plate with many customizable
    parameters

<h2 id="supported-types">
Supported experiment types
</h2>
While this tool was originally developed to automatically gate data for
a particular ddPCR assay ([*Quantitative Detection and Resolution of
BRAF V600 Status in Colorectal Cancer Using Droplet Digital PCR and a
Novel Wild-Type Negative
Assay*](https://jmd.amjpathol.org/article/S1525-1578(15)00262-7/) by Roza
Bidshahri, Dean Attali, et al.), any ddPCR experiment using an assay
with similar characteristics can also use this tool to automatically
gate the droplets. In order to benefit from the full automatic analysis,
your ddPCR experiment needs to have these characteristics:

-   The experiment uses a two-channel ddPCR assay with three expected
    droplet clusters: double-negative, double-positive, and
    single-positive.
-   The majority of droplets are empty (double-negative).
-   The majority of non-empty droplets are double-positive.
-   There can be a third cluster of either FAM+ or HEX+ droplets, but
    not both.

In other words, the built-in automatic gating will work when there are
three expected clusters of droplets: (1) double-negative, (2)
double-positive, and (3) either FAM+ or HEX+. These types of experiments
will be referred to as **(FAM+)/(FAM+HEX+)** or **(HEX+)/(FAM+HEX+)**.
Both of these experiment types fall under the name of **PNPP
experiments**; PNPP is short for PositiveNegative/PositivePositive,
which is a reflection of the droplet clusters. Here is what a typical
well from a PNPP experiment looks like:

[![Supported experiment
types](inst/vignettes-supp/supported-exp-types.png)](inst/vignettes-supp/supported-exp-types.png)

If your experiment matches the criteria for a **PNPP** experiment
(either a **(FAM+)/(FAM+HEX+)** or a **(HEX+)/(FAM+HEX+)** experiment),
then each droplet will be classified either as a rain droplet or as one
of the three expected droplet clusters (FAM+, FAM+HEX+, or
double-negative). Rain droplets are droplets that emit considerably more
fluorescence than empty droplets, but do not emit enough fluorescence to
be assigned into one of the main clusters. Here is the result of
analyzing a single well from a **(FAM+)/(FAM+HEX+)** experiment:

[![Analyze
result](inst/vignettes-supp/pnpp-simple-result.png)](inst/vignettes-supp/pnpp-simple-result.png)

If your ddPCR experiment is not a **PNPP** type, you can still use this
tool for the rest of the analysis, exploration, and plotting, but it
will not benefit from the automatic gating. However, `ddpcr` is built to
be easily extensible, which means that you can add your own experiment
type. Custom experiment types need to define their own method for gating
the droplets in a well, and then they can be used in the same way as the
built-in experiment types.

<h1 id="analysis-interactive">
Analysis using the interactive tool
</h1>
If you’re not comfortable using R and would like to use a visual tool
that requires no programming, you can [use the tool
online](http://daattali.com/shiny/ddpcr/). You should still skim through
the rest of this document (you can ignore the actual code/commands) as
it will explain some important concepts.

<h1 id="analysis-r">
Analysis using R
</h1>
Enough talking, let’s get our hands dirty.

First, install `ddpcr`

    install.packages("ddpcr")

<h2 id="r-interactive">
Running the interactive tool locally through R
</h2>
Even if you do know R, using the interactive application can be easier
and more convenient than running R commands. If you want to use the
visual tool, simply run `ddpcr::launch()` and it will run the same
application that’s hosted online on your own machine.

<h2 id="quick-start">
Quick start
</h2>
Here are two basic examples of how to use `ddpcr` to analyze and plot
your ddPCR data. One example shows an analysis where the gating
thresholds are manually set, and the other example uses the automated
analysis. Explanation will follow, these are just here as a teaser.

> Note how `ddpcr` is designed to play nicely with the [magrittr
> pipe](https://github.com/smbache/magrittr) `%>%` for easier pipeline
> workflows.

    library(ddpcr)
    dir <- sample_data_dir()

    # example 1: manually set thresholds
    plate1 <-
      new_plate(dir, type = plate_types$custom_thresholds) %>%
      subset("A01,A05") %>%
      set_thresholds(c(5000, 7500)) %>%
      analyze()

    #> Warning: package 'bindrcpp' was built under R version 3.4.4

    plot(plate1, show_grid_labels = TRUE, alpha_drops = 0.3,
           title = "Manually set gating thresholds\nworks with any data")

    # example 2: automatic gating
    new_plate(dir, type = plate_types$fam_positive_pnpp) %>%
      subset("A01:A05") %>%
      analyze() %>%
      plot(show_mutant_freq = FALSE, show_grid_labels = TRUE, alpha_drops = 0.3,
           title = "Automatic gating\nworks with PNPP experiments")

<h2 id="walkthrough">
Running a basic analysis - detailed walkthrough
</h2>
This section will go into details of how to use `ddpcr` to analyze ddPCR
data.

<h3 id="load">
Loading ddPCR data
</h3>
The first step is to get the ddPCR data into R. `ddpcr` uses the data
files that are exported by QuantaSoft as its input. If you loaded an
experiment named `2015-05-20_mouse` with 50 wells to QuantaSoft, then
QuantaSoft can export the following files:

-   50 data files (well files): each well will have its own file with
    the name ending in `*_Amplitude.csv`. For example, the droplets in
    well A01 will be saved in `2015-05-20_mouse_A01_Amplitude.csv`
    (click on the **Export Amplitude and Cluster Data** button in the
    **Setup** tab).
-   1 results file: a small file named `2015-05-20_mouse.csv` will be
    generated with some information about the plate, including the name
    of the sample in each well (click on the **Export CSV** button in
    the **Analyze** tab).

The well files are the only required input to `ddpcr`, and since ddPCR
plates contain 96 wells, you can upload anywhere from 1 to 96 well
files. The results file is not mandatory, but if you don’t provide it
then the wells will not have sample names attached to them.

`ddpcr` contains a sample dataset called `small` that has 5 wells. We
use the `new_plate()` function to initialize a new ddPCR plate object.
If given a directory, it will automatically find all the valid well
files in the directory and attempt to find a matching results file.

    library(ddpcr)
    dir <- sample_data_dir()
    plate <- new_plate(dir)

    #> Reading data files into plate... DONE (0 seconds)
    #> Initializing plate of type `ddpcr_plate`... DONE (0 seconds)

You will see some messages appear - every time `ddpcr` runs an analysis
step (initializing the plate is part of the analysis), it will output a
message describing what it’s doing. You can turn off messages by
disabling the verbose option with the command
`options(ddpcr.verbose = FALSE)`.

<h3 id="explore">
Pre-analysis exploration of the data
</h3>
We can explore the data we loaded even before doing any analysis. The
first and easiest thing to do is to plot the raw data.

    plot(plate)

![](inst/vignette_files/overview_files/figure-markdown_strict/plotraw-1.png)

Another way to get a quick overview of the data is by simply printing
the plate object.

    plate

    #>                     ddpcr plate
    #>                    -------------
    #>             Dataset name : small
    #>             Data summary : 5 wells; 72,727 drops
    #>               Plate type : ddpcr_plate
    #> Completed analysis steps : INITIALIZE
    #> Remaining analysis steps : REMOVE_FAILURES, REMOVE_OUTLIERS, REMOVE_EMPTY

Among other things, this tells us how many wells and total droplets we
have in the data, and what steps of the analysis are remaining. All the
information that gets shown when you print a ddpcr plate object is also
available through other functions that are dedicated to show one piece
of information. For example

    plate %>% name()  # equivalent to `name(plate)`

    #> [1] "small"

    plate %>% type()  # equivalent to `type(plate)`

    #> [1] "ddpcr_plate"

Since we didn’t specify an experiment type, this plate object has the
default type of `ddpcr_plate`.

We can see what wells are in our data with `wells_used()`

    plate %>% wells_used()

    #> [1] "A01" "A05" "C01" "C05" "F05"

There are 5 wells because the sample data folder has 5 well files.

We can see all the droplets data with `plate_data()`

    plate %>% plate_data()

    #> # A tibble: 72,727 x 4
    #>    well    HEX   FAM cluster
    #>    <chr> <int> <int>   <int>
    #>  1 A01     577   494       1
    #>  2 A01     515   495       1
    #>  3 A01     690   645       1
    #>  4 A01     929   860       1
    #>  5 A01     844   868       1
    #>  6 A01     942   907       1
    #>  7 A01     985   923       1
    #>  8 A01    1058   966       1
    #>  9 A01    1058   979       1
    #> 10 A01    1095  1002       1
    #> # ... with 72,717 more rows

We can see the results of the plate so far with `plate_meta()`

    plate %>% plate_meta(only_used = TRUE)

    #>   well sample row col used    target_ch1     target_ch2 drops
    #> 1  A01   Dean   A   1 TRUE Consensus_FAM WTspecific_HEX 15820
    #> 2  A05   Dave   A   5 TRUE Consensus_FAM WTspecific_HEX 13165
    #> 3  C01   Mike   C   1 TRUE Consensus_FAM WTspecific_HEX 14256
    #> 4  C05  Emily   C   5 TRUE Consensus_FAM WTspecific_HEX 14109
    #> 5  F05   Mary   F   5 TRUE Consensus_FAM WTspecific_HEX 15377

The `only_used` parameter is used so that we’ll only get data about the
5 existing wells and ignore the other 91 unused wells on the plate.
Notice that *meta* (short for *metadata*) is used instead of *results*.
This is because the meta/results table contains information for each
well such as its name, number of drops, number of empty drops,
concentration, and many other calculated values.

<h3 id="subset">
Subset the plate
</h3>
If you aren’t interested in all the wells, you can use the `subset()`
function to retain only certain wells. Alternatively, you can use the
`data_files` argument of the `new_plate()` function to only load certain
well files instead of a full directory.

The `subset()` function accepts either a list of sample names, a list of
wells, or a special *range notation*. The range notation is a convenient
way to select many wells: use a colon (`:`) to specify a range of wells
and a comma (`,`) to add another well or range. A range of wells is
defined as all wells in the rectangular area between the two endpoints.
For example, `B05:C06` corresponds to the four wells
`B05, B06, C05, C06`. The following diagram shows the result of
subsetting with a range notation of `A01:H03, C05, E06, B07:C08` on a
plate that initially contains all 96 wells.

[![Subset
example](inst/vignettes-supp/ex-subset.png)](inst/vignettes-supp/ex-subset.png)

Back to our data: we have 5 wells, let’s keep 4 of them

    plate <- plate %>% subset("A01:C05")
    # could have also used subset("A01, A05, C01, C05")
    plate %>% wells_used()

    #> [1] "A01" "A05" "C01" "C05"

<h3 id="run">
Run analysis
</h3>
An analysis of a ddPCR plate consists of running the plate through a
sequence of steps. You can see the steps of an experiment by printing
it.

    plate

    #>                     ddpcr plate
    #>                    -------------
    #>             Dataset name : small
    #>             Data summary : 4 wells; 57,350 drops
    #>               Plate type : ddpcr_plate
    #> Completed analysis steps : INITIALIZE
    #> Remaining analysis steps : REMOVE_FAILURES, REMOVE_OUTLIERS, REMOVE_EMPTY

The last two lines show which steps have been completed and which steps
remain. These steps are the default steps that any ddpcr plate will go
through by default if no type is specified. At this point all we did was
load the data, so the initialization step was done and there are 3
remaining steps. You can run all remaining steps with `analyze()`, or
run through the steps one by one using `next_step()`.

    plate <- plate %>% analyze()

    #> Identifying failed wells... DONE (0 seconds)
    #> Identifying outlier droplets... DONE (0 seconds)
    #> Identifying empty droplets... DONE (1 seconds)
    #> Analysis complete

    # equivalent to `plate %>% next_step(3)`
    # also equivalent to `plate %>% next_step() %>% next_step() %>% next_step()`

As each step of the analysis is performed, a message describing the
current step is printed to the screen. Since we only have 4 wells, it
should be very fast, but when you have a full 96-well plate, the
analysis could take several minutes. Sometimes it can be useful to run
each step individually rather than all of them together if you want to
inspect the data after each step.

<h3 id="explore2">
Post-analysis exploration of the data
</h3>
We can explore the plate again, now that it has been analyzed.

    plate

    #>         ddpcr plate
    #>        -------------
    #> Dataset name : small
    #> Data summary : 4 wells; 57,350 drops
    #>   Plate type : ddpcr_plate
    #>       Status : Analysis completed

We now get a message that says the analysis is complete (earlier it said
which steps were remaining). We can also look at the droplets data

    plate %>% plate_data()

    #> # A tibble: 57,350 x 4
    #>    well    HEX   FAM cluster
    #>    <chr> <int> <int>   <int>
    #>  1 A01     577   494       4
    #>  2 A01     515   495       4
    #>  3 A01     690   645       4
    #>  4 A01     929   860       4
    #>  5 A01     844   868       4
    #>  6 A01     942   907       4
    #>  7 A01     985   923       4
    #>  8 A01    1058   966       4
    #>  9 A01    1058   979       4
    #> 10 A01    1095  1002       4
    #> # ... with 57,340 more rows

This isn’t very informative since it shows the cluster assignment for
each droplet, which is not easy for a human to digest. Instead, this
information can be visualized by plotting the plate (coming up). We can
also look at the plate results

    plate %>% plate_meta(only_used = TRUE)

    #>   well sample row col used    target_ch1     target_ch2 drops success
    #> 1  A01   Dean   A   1 TRUE Consensus_FAM WTspecific_HEX 15820    TRUE
    #> 2  A05   Dave   A   5 TRUE Consensus_FAM WTspecific_HEX 13165    TRUE
    #> 3  C01   Mike   C   1 TRUE Consensus_FAM WTspecific_HEX 14256    TRUE
    #> 4  C05  Emily   C   5 TRUE Consensus_FAM WTspecific_HEX 14109   FALSE
    #>   drops_outlier drops_empty drops_non_empty drops_empty_fraction
    #> 1             2       13690            2130                0.865
    #> 2             1       11283            1882                0.857
    #> 3             0       12879            1377                0.903
    #> 4             0          NA              NA                   NA
    #>   concentration
    #> 1           170
    #> 2           181
    #> 3           120
    #> 4            NA

Now there’s a bit more information in the results table. The *success*
column indicates whether or not the ddPCR run was successful in that
particular well; notice how well `C05` was deemed a failure, and thus is
not included the any subsequent analysis steps.

You can use the `well_info()` function to get the value of a specific
variable of a specific well from the results. For example, we can query
the plate object to see how many empty droplets are in well `A05`.

<h3 id="plot">
Plot
</h3>
The easiest way to visualize a ddPCR plate is using the `plot()`
function.

    plate %>% plot()

![](inst/vignette_files/overview_files/figure-markdown_strict/plotsimple-1.png)

Notice well `C05` is grayed out, which means that it is a failed well.
By default, failed wells have a grey background, and empty and outlier
droplets are excluded from the plot.

You don’t have to analyze a plate object before you can plot it - a
ddPCR plate can be plotted at any time to show the data in it. If you
plot a plate before analyzing it, it’ll show the raw data.

<h3 id="plot-params">
Plot parameters
</h3>
There are many plot parameters to allow you to create extremely
customizable plots. Among the many parameters, there are three special
categories of parameters that affect the visibility of droplets:
`show_drops_*` is used to show/hide certain droplets, `col_drops_*` is
used to set the colour of droplets, and `alpha_drops_*` is used to set
the transparency of droplets (0 = transparent, 1 = opaque). The `*` can
be replaced by the name of any droplet cluster (the available clusters
can be obtained with `clusters(plate)` as mentioned earlier). For
example, to show the outlier droplets in blue, add the parameters
`show_drops_outlier = TRUE, col_drops_outlier = "blue"`.

The following two plots show examples of how to use some plot
parameters.

    plate %>% plot(wells = "A01,A05", show_full_plate = TRUE,
                   show_drops_empty = TRUE, col_drops_empty = "red",
                   title = "Show full plate")
    plate %>% plot(wells = "A01,A05", superimpose = TRUE,
                   show_grid = TRUE, show_grid_labels = TRUE, title = "Superimpose")

> To see all the available plot parameters, run `?plot.ddpcr_plate`.

<h3 id="save">
Save your data
</h3>
As was shown previously, you can use the `plate_meta()` function to
retrieve a table with the results. If you want to save that table, you
can use R’s built-in `write.csv()` or `write.table()` functions.

You can also save a ddPCR plate object using `plate_save()`. This will
create a single `.rds` file that contains an exact copy of the plate’s
current state, including all the data, attributes, and analysis progress
of the plate. The resulting file can be loaded to restore the ddPCR
object at a later time with `plate_load()`.

    plate %>% save_plate("myplate")
    from_file <- load_plate("myplate")
    identical(plate, from_file)

    #> [1] TRUE

    unlink("myplate.rds")

<h2 id="plate-type">
Analysis of different plate types
</h2>
So far we only used the default plate type in this analysis, but droplet
gating does not take place with the default type. While you can define
your own plate types (more on that later), there are three built-in
plate types you can use:

1.  **`plate_types$custom_thresholds`** - when you want to gate your
    droplets into four quadrants according to HEX and FAM values that
    you set  
2.  **`plate_types$fam_positive_pnpp`** - when you have a FAM-positive
    PNPP plate (FAM+)/(FAM+HEX+)  
3.  **`plate_types$hex_positive_pnpp`** - when you have a HEX-positive
    PNPP plate (HEX+)/(FAM+HEX+)

The next two sections explain how to use these experiment types.

<h3 id="custom-gates">
Gating droplets in any ddPCR plate with custom thresholds
</h3>
If you want to perform a simple 4-quadrant gating like the one available
in QuantaSoft, you need to set the type of the plate object to
`plate_types$custom_thresholds`. This can either be done when
initializing a new plate or by resetting an existing plate object.

    # two ways to create the desired plate
    plate_manual <- reset(plate, type = plate_types$custom_thresholds)
    plate_manual2 <- new_plate(dir, type = plate_types$custom_thresholds) %>%
      subset("A01:C05")

    # make sure the two methods above are identical
    identical(plate_manual, plate_manual2)

    #> [1] TRUE

    plate_manual

    #>                     ddpcr plate
    #>                    -------------
    #>             Dataset name : small
    #>             Data summary : 4 wells; 57,350 drops
    #>               Plate type : custom_thresholds, ddpcr_plate
    #> Completed analysis steps : INITIALIZE
    #> Remaining analysis steps : REMOVE_OUTLIERS, CLASSIFY

It’s usually a good idea to take a look at the raw data to decide where
the draw the thresholds

    plot(plate_manual, show_grid_labels = TRUE)

![](inst/vignette_files/overview_files/figure-markdown_strict/plotcrosshair-1.png)

If you noticed, there’s a droplet in well *A05* that has a much larger
fluorescence value and is probably an outlier, which is the reason the
scale is a bit too large. After analyzing the plate, it will be
identified as an outlier and hidden automatically. Before running the
analysis, we should set where the thresholds will be. By default, the
thresholds are at (5000, 5000), which is very arbitrary. It looks like
the x coordinate is fine, but the y border should move up to
approximately 8000. Then run the analysis.

    # what are the current thresholds?
    thresholds(plate_manual)

    #> [1] "(5000, 5000)"

    # set the thresholds to (5000,8000)
    thresholds(plate_manual) <- c(5000, 8000)
    plate_manual <- analyze(plate_manual)

    #> Identifying outlier droplets... DONE (0 seconds)
    #> Classifying droplets... DONE (0 seconds)
    #> Analysis complete

Now the plate is ready and we can plot it or look at its results

    plot(plate_manual)

![](inst/vignette_files/overview_files/figure-markdown_strict/crosshairresults-1.png)

By default, the droplets in each quadrant are a different colour. If you
want to change the colour of some droplets, we can use the `col_drops_*`
parameter as before. Since now we’re working with a different plate
type, the names of the droplet clusters can be different, so we need to
first know what they are

    clusters(plate_manual)

    #> [1] "UNDEFINED"     "OUTLIER"       "EMPTY"         "X_POSITIVE"   
    #> [5] "Y_POSITIVE"    "BOTH_POSITIVE"

Now if we want to change the colour of the double-positive droplets to
red, we just add a parameter `col_drops_both_positive = "red"`.

<h3 id="pnpp">
Gating droplets in PNPP experiments automatically
</h3>
If you have a *PNPP* experiment (*(FAM+)/(FAM+HEX+)* or
*(HEX+)/(FAM+HEX+)*), then `ddpcr` can perform a fully automatic
analysis on the plate. The sample dataset used in this running example
is from a *(FAM+)/(FAM+HEX+)* experiment, so we can take advantage of
the automatic gating if we set the type to
`plate_types$fam_positive_pnpp`.

Let’s create a new plate object of the desired type.

    plate_pnpp <- new_plate(dir, type = plate_types$fam_positive_pnpp)

    #> Reading data files into plate... DONE (0 seconds)
    #> Initializing plate of type `fam_positive_pnpp`... DONE (0 seconds)

If the data were *(HEX+)/(FAM+HEX+)*, we would have used
`type = plate_types$hex_positive_pnpp` instead.

<h4 id="pnpp-clusters">
Clusters of a PNPP experiment
</h4>
Before running the analysis, it’s a good idea to know what are the
possible cluster groupings that a droplet can belong to

    clusters(plate_pnpp)

    #> [1] "UNDEFINED" "FAILED"    "OUTLIER"   "EMPTY"     "RAIN"      "POSITIVE" 
    #> [7] "NEGATIVE"

The first 4 clusters we’ve seen before, as they are common to all plate
types. Droplets in the *HEX+FAM+* cluster are considered *POSITIVE*,
while droplets in the *FAM+* cluster are considered *NEGATIVE* since
they are *HEX-*. Any droplets that are not empty but don’t emit enough
fluorescent intensity to be in the *POSITIVE* or *NEGATIVE* clusters are
considered *RAIN*.

<h4 id="pnpp-analysis">
Analysis of a PNPP experiment
</h4>
Now we can analyze the plate

    plate_pnpp <- analyze(plate_pnpp)

    #> Identifying failed wells... DONE (0 seconds)
    #> Identifying outlier droplets... DONE (0 seconds)
    #> Identifying empty droplets... DONE (0 seconds)
    #> Classifying droplets... DONE (0 seconds)
    #> Reclassifying droplets... skipped (not enough wells with significant mutant clusters)
    #> Analysis complete

One of the key goals in running the analysis is to determine the number
of *POSITIVE* (wildtype) and *NEGATIVE* (mutant) droplets in each well,
and similarly the *mutant frequency* (if a well has 95 wildtype droplets
and 5 mutant droplets, then the *mutant frequency* in the well is 5%).

You can see from the output that the two last steps are **classifying**
and **reclassifying** the droplets, and that the reclassification didn’t
take place. The classification step identifies all the non-empty
droplets as either rain, mutant, or wildtype by analyzing each well
individually. Wells with a very low *mutant frequency* (i.e. there are
very few mutant droplets) are much harder to gate accurately, which is
the reason for the reclassification step. The reclassification step uses
information from wells with high a *mutant frequency*, where the gates
are more clearly defined, to adjust the gates in wells with a low
*mutant frequency*. The reclassification step only takes place if there
are enough wells with a high mutant frequency.

Explanation of some of the variables:

-   **mutant\_num** and **wildtype\_num** - the number of mutant and
    wildtype droplets
-   **mutant\_freq** - the frequency (0-1) of non-empty, non-rain
    droplets that are in the mutant cluster
-   **significant\_mutant\_cluster** - TRUE if the the well contains a
    statistically significant number of mutant droplets

Plotting the data is usually the best way to see the results

    plate_pnpp %>% plot(text_size_mutant_freq = 8)

![](inst/vignette_files/overview_files/figure-markdown_strict/pnppplot-1.png)

> To see all the available plot parameters for this plate type, run
> `?plot.pnpp_experiment`. In addition, any plot parameter that is

> listed under `?plot.ddpcr_plate`).

The wildtype droplets are green and the mutant droplets are purple. The
well colours themselves reflect the **significant\_mutant\_cluster**
variable: wells that are mostly wildtype droplets are green, and wells
with significant mutant clusters are purple. There are parameters to set
all these colours, the transparency levels, and many more options.

Similar to how `wells_failed()` returns the failed wells, you can use
the `wells_mutant()` and `wells_wildtype()` functions to extract the
wells with a significant mutant cluster and those without.

    plate_pnpp %>% wells_mutant()

    #> [1] "A05" "F05"

    plate_pnpp %>% wells_wildtype()

    #> [1] "A01" "C01"

<h2 id="plate-params">
Advanced topic 1: Plate parameters
</h2>
Every ddPCR plate object has adjustable parameters associated with it.
There are general parameters that apply to the plate as a whole, and
each analysis step has its own set of parameters that are used for the
algorithm in that step. You can see all the parameters of a plate using
the `params()` function

    plate %>% params() %>% str()

    #> List of 4
    #>  $ GENERAL        :List of 4
    #>   ..$ X_VAR         : chr "HEX"
    #>   ..$ Y_VAR         : chr "FAM"
    #>   ..$ DROPLET_VOLUME: num 0.00085
    #>   ..$ RANDOM_SEED   : num 8
    #>  $ REMOVE_FAILURES:List of 3
    #>   ..$ TOTAL_DROPS_T      : num 5000
    #>   ..$ EMPTY_LAMBDA_LOW_T : num 0.3
    #>   ..$ EMPTY_LAMBDA_HIGH_T: num 0.99
    #>  $ REMOVE_OUTLIERS:List of 2
    #>   ..$ TOP_PERCENT: num 1
    #>   ..$ CUTOFF_IQR : num 5
    #>  $ REMOVE_EMPTY   :List of 1
    #>   ..$ CUTOFF_SD: num 7

You can also view the parameters for a specific step or the value of a
parameter. For example, to see the parameters used in the step that
identifies failed wells, use

    plate %>% params("REMOVE_FAILURES")

    #> $TOTAL_DROPS_T
    #> [1] 5000
    #> 
    #> $EMPTY_LAMBDA_LOW_T
    #> [1] 0.3
    #> 
    #> $EMPTY_LAMBDA_HIGH_T
    #> [1] 0.99

You can also view or edit specific parameters. When identifying failed
wells, one of the conditions for a successful run is to have at least
5,000 droplets in the well (Bio-Rad claims that every well has 20,000
droplets). If you know that your particular experiment had much fewer
droplets than usual and as a result `ddpcr` thinks that all the wells
are failures, you can change the setting

    params(plate, "REMOVE_FAILURES", "TOTAL_DROPS_T")

    #> [1] 5000

    params(plate, "REMOVE_FAILURES", "TOTAL_DROPS_T") <- 1000
    params(plate, "REMOVE_FAILURES", "TOTAL_DROPS_T")

    #> [1] 1000

If you look at the full parameters of the plate, you’ll notice that by
default `ddpcr` assumes that the dyes used are *FAM* and *HEX*. If you
are using a different dye and want the name of that dye appear in the
results instead, you can use the `x_var()` or `y_var()` functions.

    orig_x <- x_var(plate)
    orig_x

    #> [1] "HEX"

    x_var(plate) <- "VIC"
    plate %>% plate_data() %>% names()

    #> [1] "well"    "VIC"     "FAM"     "cluster"

    x_var(plate) <- orig_x

Note that if you change any parameters, you need to re-run the analysis.
If you try running `analyze()` after a plate has already been analyzed,
you will simply get a message saying the plate is already analyzed. To
force an already-analyzed plate to re-run the analysis, you need to use
the `restart = TRUE` parameter.

    plate <- analyze(plate)

    #> Analysis complete

    plate <- analyze(plate, restart = TRUE)

    #> Restarting analysis

    #> Initializing plate of type `ddpcr_plate`... DONE (0 seconds)

    #> Analysis complete

<h2 id="algorithms">
Advanced topic 2: Algorithms used in each step
</h2>
If you want to know how a step is performed, you can see the exact
algorithm (code) used in each step by consulting the `steps()` function.

    plate_pnpp %>% steps

    #> $INITIALIZE
    #> [1] "init_plate"

This list contains all the steps of analyzing the given plate, with each
item in the list containing both the name of the step and the R function
that performs it. For example, the first step is *INITIALIZE* and it
uses the function `init_plate()`. You can see the code for that function
by running `ddpcr:::init_plate`.

    ddpcr:::init_plate

Each ddPCR plate has a plate type which determines what type of analysis
to run on the data. `plate_types` contains a list of the built-in plate
types that are supported, but you can also create your own plate type.
Create a new plate type if you want to supply your own logic for any
analysis step, or even if you simply want to have a type that sets
different default parameters than the built-in ones.
